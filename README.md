handwritten digit classification using random forest
The project involves loading the digits dataset, visualizing some of the handwritten digits, preprocessing the data by reshaping and normalizing it, and then splitting it into training and testing sets. A Random Forest Classifier is trained on the training data, and its performance is evaluated using a confusion matrix and classification report. Finally, the model can be used to make predictions on new data.
